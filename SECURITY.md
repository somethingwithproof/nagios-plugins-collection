# Security policy

Security fixes target the latest maintained 2.x release. Older project lines
are outside the current support contract; upgrade using the release and migration
documentation. A platform must still receive vendor security updates and belong
to the verified release matrix. Expired support records block CI and publication.

Report sensitive findings through a private GitHub security advisory:
https://github.com/somethingwithproof/nagios-plugins-collection/security/advisories/new

If private reporting is unavailable to your account, contact the maintainer at
the public author address, thomasvincent@gmail.com. Include affected versions,
impact and a minimal redacted reproducer. Do not put passwords, API keys or
private endpoint data in public issues. Response and fix timing depend on the
finding; this policy does not promise an unverified response SLA.

Use verified TLS and explicit private CA trust, least-privilege credentials and
root-owned package files. Store deployment secrets in Ansible Vault or an
appropriate runtime secret store. Third-party dependency installs used for
release builds are hash-locked and wheel-only. Signed/attested artifacts and
SHA256SUMS provide release verification evidence; review the workflow and its
source commit when assessing an artifact.

The supported OS/runtime matrix and its lifecycle sources are documented in
README.md and the project's machine-readable platform policy. Source examples
for undeployed features are not additional platform support guarantees.
